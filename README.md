## History

[Create IsoCam Addon](https://www.reinerstilesets.de/blender/createisocam.py) written by brilliant [Reiner 'Tiles' Prokein](https://www.reinerstilesets.de/)
for Blender 2.6 is not compatible with Blender 2.91, so I rewrite his code and made some minor improvements.

_And this is my first attempt to write a Blender addon (:3)_

## How to use

`Preferences->Addon->Install->isometric_cameras.py`, enable it,
 
 In 3D view, `Shift-A->Camera->Isometric Camera`
