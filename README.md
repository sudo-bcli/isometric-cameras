# Blender Addon: Isometric Camera

## Download



## What?

Cameras with Isometric projection can be used to render sprites for 45 degree tile based games.

See:

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection)
* [Article](https://www.blender3darchitect.com/architectural-visualization/create-true-isometric-camera-architecture/)
* [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycYkyxwHr4)

## Why?

[Create IsoCam Addon](https://www.reinerstilesets.de/blender/createisocam.py) by brilliant [Reiner 'Tiles' Prokein](https://www.reinerstilesets.de/)
is a little bit too old so I rewrite his code to fit Blender 2.91.

_Don't tell anybody that this is my first Blender Addon (:3)_

## How?

`Preferences->Addon->Install->isometric_cameras.py`
 
 Enable it, and in 3D view, `Shift-A->Camera->Isometric Camera`
